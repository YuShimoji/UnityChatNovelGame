Phase: Phase 6 (Verification & Report) -> Phase 4 (Ticket Creation)

## Verification Results

### TASK_007: Core System Proof of Concept (Verification)
- **Status**: **FAILED** (Incomplete)
- **Findings**:
  - `Assets/Scenes/DebugChatScene.unity`: **MISSING** (DoD specific requirement).
  - `docs/evidence/`: **EMPTY** (Missing `task007_chat_ui.png`, `task007_console_logs.png`).
  - `Assets/Editor/DebugSceneGenerator.cs`: **FOUND** (Worker seemingly created a generator but didn't commit the scene or evidence).
  - `docs/inbox/REPORT_TASK_007_Verification.md`: **FOUND** (Claims success, but evidence is missing).

## Decisions
1. **Reject TASK_007**: The task is not "Done" according to DoD. Evidence is mandatory.
2. **Action**: The Worker (User) must run the scene (via Generator if needed) and capture evidence/commit the scene.
3. **Momentum**: While rejecting 007, we will proceed to **Task Formulation** (Phase 4) for the next features to keep the project moving, assuming 007 will be fixed quickly.

## Next Actions
- Update MISSION_LOG: Mark TASK_007 as OPEN (or RETRY).
- Create TASK_008 (Deduction Board) Ticket.
